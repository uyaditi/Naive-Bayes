## üìù Naive Bayes Machine Learning

This project showcases the implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch and using the scikit-learn library (sklearn). Naive Bayes is a popular classification algorithm that utilizes the Bayes' theorem to make predictions based on the assumption of independence between features.

**Project Structure:**
The project contains the following files:

1. `Naive_Bayes_from_scratch.ipynb`:
   - This file implements the Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch.
   - The algorithm calculates the probabilities of each class and feature using the training data.
   - It then uses these probabilities to predict the class of new instances.
   
2. `Naive_Bayes_Classification_with_sklearn.ipynb`:
   - This file demonstrates the usage of the Naive Bayes algorithm from the scikit-learn library (sklearn).
   - It utilizes the `sklearn.naive_bayes` module to train and predict using Naive Bayes.

**Getting Started:**
To run the Naive Bayes algorithms:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed (e.g., numpy, pandas, scikit-learn).
3. Open the desired implementation file in your Python IDE or text editor.
4. Modify the code if needed, such as adjusting file paths or hyperparameters.
5. Run the code and observe the results.
